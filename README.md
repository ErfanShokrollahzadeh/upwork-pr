# Prototype homepage

This is a quick static prototype for the building & decoration website mockup. It contains a hero, services section, project gallery (with lightbox), and a contact form skeleton.

How to view locally

Option A — open file directly (macOS):

```bash
open /Users/delart/Desktop/upwork-pr/index.html
```

Option B — simple local server (recommended to allow iframe maps):

```bash
cd /Users/delart/Desktop/upwork-pr
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in browser
```

What this is

- Static HTML/CSS/JS prototype for review and early feedback.
- Not a finished production site: contact form uses mailto and the map iframe is a placeholder.

Next steps I can take after you review

- Tweak styles or copy per client brand (colors, fonts, logo).
- Produce a Figma mock or export images.
- Move this into a WordPress skeleton using a chosen theme and Elementor.
